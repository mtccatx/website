## Using Rust

Hello rustacean! Rust is awesome, but takes up so much space. So we're going to
share, and we're going to use a system-wide install of rust. It's present at
`/opt/rust`.

Here's a snippet from my [fish](https://fishshell.com/) config that I use to
access rust tools, you'll have to figure out the equivalent for your shell.

```bash
source "/opt/rust/env.fish"
set -x RUSTUP_HOME=/opt/rust
```

Note that you'll still have `~/.cargo` for anything you build or install
yourself, the only thing that's shared is the rust toolchain. If you decide that
you're not a morally upright person (or if you just need a specific or
non-stable toolchain version) and you're okay with really eating up our shared
disk space, you can always unset `RUSTUP_HOME`, run `rustup default stable` (or
whatever version/tag of rust you want), and it'll install it to your home
directory. I'd recommend that you build elsewhere and cross compile though - the
compute resources on `moontower` are also pretty limited, so it's really not a
great development experience. Rust isn't necessarily installed here to
facilitate development so much as just providing access to utilities installable
through `cargo`.
