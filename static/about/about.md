# Moontower Computer Club Mission Statement

+ Moontower Computer Club is a community around doing computer.
+ "doing computer" is an intentionally vague term - we support computing in a broad context, and hope to include a broad audience.
+ We strive to share our creations and ideas with each other
+ We work together and reuse each others work.

# Moontower Computer Club Code of Conduct

Moontower Computer Club is a community around doing computer. To keep our community healthy and welcoming to all, this is our code of conduct:

+ We allow people to do computer in their own context and their own way.
+ Respect people's identities as they express it even if it's not what you expect it to be (sex, sexuality, race, gender, pronouns, and many others)
+ Allow people to hold opinions you donâ€™t agree with
+ Make people feel safe, whether it's in the context of learning or socializing.
+ We are active listeners.
+ We give space to each other to talk about things we are interested in.
+ We celebrate members of community and uplift their voices.
+ Be pro-social while computering - we're here to build human connections related to computer.
+ Be kind.

Some things we explicitly avoid:

+ Talking over others. Computing has a reputation of the loudest voices winning,
  and we want to challenge that.
+ Belittling others or their ideas
+ Discrimination (sexism, racism, classism, etc.) whether subtle or overt
+ Flexing - you don't need to prove that you're cool to us, we already know!
+ Telling people what they should do or who they should be
+ Debating without consent
