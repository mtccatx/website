<h1 id="moontower-computer-club-mission-statement">Moontower Computer
Club Mission Statement</h1>
<ul>
<li>Moontower Computer Club is a community around doing computer.</li>
<li>"doing computer" is an intentionally vague term - we support
computing in a broad context, and hope to include a broad audience.</li>
<li>We strive to share our creations and ideas with each other</li>
<li>We work together and reuse each others work.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="moontower-computer-club-code-of-conduct">Moontower Computer Club
Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>Moontower Computer Club is a community around doing computer. To keep
our community healthy and welcoming to all, this is our code of
conduct:</p>
<ul>
<li>We allow people to do computer in their own context and their own
way.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Respect people's identities as they express it even if it’s not what
you expect it to be (sex, sexuality, race, gender, pronouns, and many
others)</li>
<li>Allow people to hold opinions you don’t agree with</li>
<li>Make people feel safe, whether it's in the context of learning or
socializing.</li>
<li>We are active listeners.</li>
<li>We give space to each other to talk about things we are interested
in.</li>
<li>We celebrate members of community and uplift their voices.</li>
<li>Be pro-social while computering - we're here to build human
connections related to computer.</li>
<li>Be kind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things we explicitly avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interrupting others - our community can only thrive if we allow
people to communicate freely. Computing has a reputation of the loudest
voices winning, and we want to challenge that.</li>
<li>Belittling others or their ideas</li>
<li>Discrimination (sexism, racism, classism, etc.) whether subtle or
overt</li>
<li>Flexing - you don't need to prove that you're cool to us, we already
know!</li>
<li>Telling people what they should do or who they should be</li>
<li>Debating without consent</li>
</ul>
